# @minimal-analytics/heap

This package is a slimmed down (**1KB GZipped**), drop-in replacement for the official Heap IO library. It provides page view and automatic interaction tracking. Custom events can be handled in your application by calling `track` with your custom event type when needed.

The package works by calling the Heap API directly, no further integrations are required.

This is intended for those who want to minimize the impact of third-party JavaScript, while maintaining essential analytics tracking. If you require the more advanced tracking that Heap provides, it's recommended you use the official version instead.
